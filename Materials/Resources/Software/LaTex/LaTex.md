# LaTeX

- If you are new to LaTeX, I recommend you use the WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean)  software *Lyx*, which can be downloaded here: https://www.lyx.org/

- You should also check out *overleaf* -- an online collaborative LaTeX editor: https://www.overleaf.com/
    - If you are collaborating your homework/final project with other students, *overleaf* can be particularly convenient.

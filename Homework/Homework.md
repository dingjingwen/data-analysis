# Homework Guidelines 

## General

- Each assignment will be graded on a 0 - 4 scale.
    - Truly exceptional assignment may get a 5 and will be posted on the course repo.
- Up to *two* people are allowed to work on the same assignment. In that case, the assignment will have two authors.
    - If two people co-author an assignment, each person needs to submit it independently.

## Format

- You should compile your assignment to `pdf` or `html` and submit on SPOC. 
- If your work involves data simulation and analysis, and if you use `R` or `python` as your programming language, it is recommended that you write your assignment in `R markdown` or `Jupyter notebook`. 
    - make sure to compile to `pdf` or `html` before submitting
- Otherwise, it is recommended that you write your assignment in `LaTeX`. 
    - For `Stata` users, there is an option to write `Stata markdown` although I have not tried it. 
- In addition to the written assignment, you should submit all source code files and data associated with your homework.

## Content

- The content of your homework assignment has to be **lecture-related**. 
- Each homework can be one of the following:
    1. Theoretical report
    2. Paper Summary
    3. Simulation or Empirical Analysis

## Theoretical Report

- Write a short report (1 - 2 pages) on a lecture-related topic.
- [Examples](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Foundations%20of%20Statistical%20Learning/Student%20Submission)

## Paper Summary

- You can write a summary of either a *methodology* paper or an *empirical* paper.
- The paper has to be picked from our [reading list](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/assets/reading_list.pdf). If you would like to do a paper outside the reading list, please contact me for approval.
- For *methodology* papers, you should summarize the method proposed by the authors and it is encouraged that you try to implement the methodology using a simulated or real data set to demonstrate its effectiveness. 
- For *empirical* papers, your summary should resemble a **referee report**: in addition to summarizing the main idea, contributions, data, methods, and findings of the paper, you should attempt to offer your own criticism: has the paper successfully addressed its questions? What are some of its limitations? Do you have suggestions for improvement? 
    - See [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Resources) for guidelines on writing referee reports.  

## Simulation or Empirical Analysis

- Demonstrate or apply a statistical/econometric method introduced in or relevant to the lecture. 
- You can either simulate a data set or analyze real data (encouraged).
- You **must** include your code with your report.
- Examples: [[1](https://github.com/philippbauch/simple-linear-regression-notebook/blob/master/linear-regression-demo.ipynb)], [[2](https://xiaoluli97.github.io/2019/04/06/DA-A3/)], [[3](https://lzc563236.github.io/2019/04/21/Homework4/)]

## Academic Integrity
- You **must** reference any sources - including online sources - that you used in your writing using proper citations.
- You **must** acknowledge any sentences or codes that are not written by yourself.
- Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. If it is found that you used sources without proper reference, you will get a zero for your homework the first time and you will fail the course the second time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- I do not have any friends. I expect to do all the homework by myself. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those that are the results of collaboration? Would that be unfair?
    - Whether an assignment is written by one student or two, will be not be a factor of consideration in initial evaluation. However, at the end of the semester, your homework grades will be adjusted to reflect your proper contribution. This means that if you write your homework alone, your grades will be bumped up at the end of the semester. Conversely, if you work in groups of two, you need to do a better job!
